# PSScripts
Powershell scripts that I have created at work to use at work. I have uploaded them here to my GitHub so that I do not lose them. They are pretty simple but they have helped me speed up tasks in Office 365 management and other Active Directory things.

### TODO
Need to add notes to all the scripts that give a quick overview of what the script does.
